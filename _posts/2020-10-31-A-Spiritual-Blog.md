## A really short spiritual blog (Online School)

For some people, not being able to go out is one of the worst situations they could ever be in. Socializing and having relationships are the things they couldn't do. It doesn't matter that much to me, since I play video games and chat with my online friends. Since online school has started and almost a term has passed, I might as well go make a blog about the experience.

The teachers give us a lesson once a week for every subject. Most of the assessments have been good but there are some below-average ones. Though some are bad, there are 5 attempts so I don't have to stare at the monitor blankly when I didn't get to pass the assessment. Sometimes, I get tired of doing it so I take the whole day off to just play video games, read manga, or watch anime. There have been times where I have been so lazy that I forgot some of my assessments are nearing the deadline, yet I still manage to pass my assessments on time. I don't know how, but it happens.

I guess some downsides to not being able to go to a real classroom is that I don't have allowances and I can't buy a Big Mac. But other than that there isn't that much I would complain about.
